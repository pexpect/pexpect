'''This is for cleaning up binary files improperly added to CVS. This script
scans the given path to find binary files; checks with CVS to see if the sticky
options are set to -kb; finally if sticky options are not -kb then uses 'cvs
admin' to set the -kb option.

This script ignores CVS directories, symbolic links, and files not known under
CVS control (cvs status is 'Unknown').

Run this on a CHECKED OUT module sandbox, not on the repository itself. After
if fixes the sticky options on any files you should manually do a 'cvs commit'
to accept the changes. Then be sure to have all users do a 'cvs up -A' to
update the Sticky Option status.
