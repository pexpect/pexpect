This is a standard Python Distutil distribution. To install simply run:

    python setup.py install

This makes Pexpect available to any script on the machine. You need
root access to install it this way. If you do not have root access or
if you do not wish to install Pexpect so that is available to any script
then you can just copy the pexpect.py file to same directory as your script.
