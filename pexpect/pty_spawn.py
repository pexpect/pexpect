        ignore_sighup=True, echo=True):

        '''This is the constructor. The command parameter may be a string that
        includes a command and any arguments to the command. For example::

            child = pexpect.spawn('/usr/bin/ftp')
            child = pexpect.spawn('/usr/bin/ssh user@example.com')
            child = pexpect.spawn('ls -latr /tmp')

        You may also construct it with a list of arguments like so::

            child = pexpect.spawn('/usr/bin/ftp', [])
            child = pexpect.spawn('/usr/bin/ssh', ['user@example.com'])
            child = pexpect.spawn('ls', ['-latr', '/tmp'])

        After this the child application will be created and will be ready to
        talk to. For normal use, see expect() and send() and sendline().

        Remember that Pexpect does NOT interpret shell meta characters such as
        redirect, pipe, or wild cards (``>``, ``|``, or ``*``). This is a
        common mistake.  If you want to run a command and pipe it through
        another command then you must also start a shell. For example::

            child = pexpect.spawn('/bin/bash -c "ls -l | grep LOG > logs.txt"')
            child.expect(pexpect.EOF)

        The second form of spawn (where you pass a list of arguments) is useful
        in situations where you wish to spawn a command and pass it its own
        argument list. This can make syntax more clear. For example, the
        following is equivalent to the previous example::

            shell_cmd = 'ls -l | grep LOG > logs.txt'
            child = pexpect.spawn('/bin/bash', ['-c', shell_cmd])
            child.expect(pexpect.EOF)

        The maxread attribute sets the read buffer size. This is maximum number
        of bytes that Pexpect will try to read from a TTY at one time. Setting
        the maxread size to 1 will turn off buffering. Setting the maxread
        value higher may help performance in cases where large amounts of
        output are read back from the child. This feature is useful in
        conjunction with searchwindowsize.

        The searchwindowsize attribute sets the how far back in the incoming
        seach buffer Pexpect will search for pattern matches. Every time
        Pexpect reads some data from the child it will append the data to the
        incoming buffer. The default is to search from the beginning of the
        incoming buffer each time new data is read from the child. But this is
        very inefficient if you are running a command that generates a large
        amount of data where you want to match. The searchwindowsize does not
        affect the size of the incoming data buffer. You will still have
        access to the full buffer after expect() returns.

        The logfile member turns on or off logging. All input and output will
        be copied to the given file object. Set logfile to None to stop
        logging. This is the default. Set logfile to sys.stdout to echo
        everything to standard output. The logfile is flushed after each write.

        Example log input and output to a file::

            child = pexpect.spawn('some_command')
            fout = open('mylog.txt','wb')
            child.logfile = fout

        Example log to stdout::

            # In Python 2:
            child = pexpect.spawn('some_command')
            child.logfile = sys.stdout

            # In Python 3, spawnu should be used to give str to stdout:
            child = pexpect.spawnu('some_command')
            child.logfile = sys.stdout

        The logfile_read and logfile_send members can be used to separately log
        the input from the child and output sent to the child. Sometimes you
        don't want to see everything you write to the child. You only want to
        log what the child sends back. For example::

            child = pexpect.spawn('some_command')
            child.logfile_read = sys.stdout

        Remember to use spawnu instead of spawn for the above code if you are
        using Python 3.

        To separately log output sent to the child use logfile_send::

            child.logfile_send = fout

        If ``ignore_sighup`` is True, the child process will ignore SIGHUP
        signals. For now, the default is True, to preserve the behaviour of
        earlier versions of Pexpect, but you should pass this explicitly if you
        want to rely on it.

        The delaybeforesend helps overcome a weird behavior that many users
        were experiencing. The typical problem was that a user would expect() a
        "Password:" prompt and then immediately call sendline() to send the
        password. The user would then see that their password was echoed back
        to them. Passwords don't normally echo. The problem is caused by the
        fact that most applications print out the "Password" prompt and then
        turn off stdin echo, but if you send your password before the
        application turned off echo, then you get your password echoed.
        Normally this wouldn't be a problem when interacting with a human at a
        real keyboard. If you introduce a slight delay just before writing then
        this seems to clear up the problem. This was such a common problem for
        many users that I decided that the default pexpect behavior should be
        to sleep just before writing to the child application. 1/20th of a
        second (50 ms) seems to be enough to clear up the problem. You can set
        delaybeforesend to 0 to return to the old behavior. Most Linux machines
        don't like this to be below 0.03. I don't know why.

        Note that spawn is clever about finding commands on your path.
        It uses the same logic that "which" uses to find executables.

        If you wish to get the exit status of the child you must call the
        close() method. The exit or signal status of the child will be stored
        in self.exitstatus or self.signalstatus. If the child exited normally
        then exitstatus will store the exit return code and signalstatus will
        be None. If the child was terminated abnormally with a signal then
        signalstatus will store the signal value and exitstatus will be None.
        If you need more detail you can also read the self.status member which
        stores the status returned by os.waitpid. You can interpret this using
        os.WIFEXITED/os.WEXITSTATUS or os.WIFSIGNALED/os.TERMSIG.

        The echo attribute may be set to False to disable echoing of input.
        As a pseudo-terminal, all input echoed by the "keyboard" (send()
        or sendline()) will be repeated to output.  For many cases, it is
        not desirable to have echo enabled, and it may be later disabled
        using setecho(False) followed by waitnoecho().  However, for some
        platforms such as Solaris, this is not possible, and should be
        disabled immediately on spawn.

        Strings will be compiled to re types. This returns the index into the

        successful match. This may raise exceptions for EOF or TIMEOUT. To
        avoid the EOF or TIMEOUT exceptions add EOF or TIMEOUT to the pattern
        list. That will cause expect to match an EOF or TIMEOUT condition
        instead of raising an exception.

        If you pass a list of patterns and more than one matches, the first
        match in the stream is chosen. If more than one pattern matches at that

        Please note, however, that buffering can affect this behavior, since

            # the input is 'foobar'
            index = p.expect(['foobar', 'foo'])

        After a match is found the instance attributes 'before', 'after' and
        'match' will be set. You can see all the data read before the match in
        'before'. You can see the data that was matched in 'after'. The
        re.MatchObject used in the re match will be in 'match'. If an error

        A list entry may be EOF or TIMEOUT instead of a string. This will
        catch these exceptions and return the index of the list entry instead
        of raising the exception. The attribute 'after' will be set to the
        exception type. The attribute 'match' will be None. This allows you to
        write code like this::

                index = p.expect(['good', 'bad', pexpect.EOF, pexpect.TIMEOUT])
                if index == 0:
                    do_something()
                elif index == 1:
                    do_something_else()
                elif index == 2:
                    do_some_other_thing()
                elif index == 3:
                    do_something_completely_different()

        instead of code like this::

                try:
                    index = p.expect(['good', 'bad'])
                    if index == 0:
                        do_something()
                    elif index == 1:
                        do_something_else()
                except EOF:
                    do_some_other_thing()
                except TIMEOUT:
                    do_something_completely_different()

        These two forms are equivalent. It all depends on what you want. You
        can also just expect the EOF if you are waiting for all output of a
        child to finish. For example::

                p = pexpect.spawn('/bin/ls')
                p.expect(pexpect.EOF)
                print p.before

        If you are trying to optimize for speed then see expect_list().

        On Python 3.4, or Python 3.3 with asyncio installed, passing
        ``async=True``  will make this return an :mod:`asyncio` coroutine,
        which you can yield from to get the same result that this method would
        normally give directly. So, inside a coroutine, you can replace this code::

            index = p.expect(patterns)

        With this non-blocking form::

            index = yield from p.expect(patterns, async=True)

        may help if you are trying to optimize for speed, otherwise just use
        the expect() method.  This is called by expect(). If timeout==-1 then

        it echos the real stdin to the child stdin. When the user types the
        escape_character this method will stop. The default for

        the ESC character. ASCII 29 was chosen for historical merit because

        escape_character will not be sent to the child process.

        You may pass in optional input and output filter functions. These
